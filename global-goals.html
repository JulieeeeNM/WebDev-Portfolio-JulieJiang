            <h2>SDG 4: Quality Education</h2>
            <p>Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to escaping poverty. Over the past decade, major progress was made towards increasing access to education and school enrollment rates at all levels, particularly for girls. Nevertheless, about 260 million children were still out of school in 2018 — nearly one fifth of the global population in that age group.</p>
            
            <h3>Targets</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>By 2030, ensure that all girls and boys complete free, equitable and quality primary and secondary education</li>
                <li>By 2030, ensure equal access for all women and men to affordable and quality technical, vocational and tertiary education</li>
                <li>By 2030, substantially increase the number of youth and adults who have relevant skills for employment</li>
                <li>Build and upgrade education facilities that are child, disability and gender sensitive</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Current Challenges</h3>
            <p>Before the coronavirus crisis, projections showed that more than 200 million children would be out of school, and only 60 per cent of young people would be completing upper secondary education in 2030. The pandemic has exacerbated these challenges, with school closures affecting more than 90% of the world's student population.</p>
